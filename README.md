This repo contains base decompiled source codes for various builds of the game. It will not be cleaned up but rather used for referencing.

- [JAP_1998_05_29](JAP_1998_05_29) the final retail Japanese release
- [PAL_1997_12_12](PAL_1997_12_12) the beta build "Easy As Pie"

Currently overlays are broken and the code for those is either missing or has wrong function names. I will get around to fixing this.
